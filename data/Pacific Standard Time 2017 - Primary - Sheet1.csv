Sacred Art in the Age of Contact: Chumash and Latin American Traditions in Santa Barbara ,"Highlighting themes of sacred geography, language, materiality, and resistance, this exhibition investigates the mutually transformative interaction between Chumash and Latin American cultures in Santa Barbara's history.


Sacred Art in the Age of Contact: Chumash and Latin American Traditions in Santa Barbara in the Age of Contact brings together, for the first time, a diverse body of objects from Santa Barbara area collections, many of which have never been on display, dating from the first decades following the Chumash’s first contact with the Spanish, c. 1769-1824. Together, these materials offer a fuller picture of the relationship between art and spirituality in both Chumash and Spanish traditions, and demonstrate the sustained deployment of Chumash visual systems by native artists in early colonial visual culture. Highlighting themes of sacred geography, language, materiality and resistance, Sacred Art investigates the mutually transformative interaction between these traditions, which have immediate implications on the ways in which the cultural dynamics of Santa Barbara County are understood today.

Suzanne Lacy & Pablo Helguera,"

This exhibit juxtaposes key examples of the artists’ works in photography, installation, drawing, and performance, with themes of immigration, pedagogy, race, populism or social organizing, and theatricality.

Suzanne Lacy & Pablo Helguera pairs for the first time the work of two of the leading practitioners of the Public Practice movement. Suzanne Lacy, born in 1945 in Wasco, CA and based in Los Angeles, has played a key role in Public Practice since the 1970s, addressing political matters such as the women’s and civil rights movements through performance-based art that engaged the public and advocated for change or questioned societal norms. Pablo Helguera, born in 1971 in Mexico City and based in New York City, represents the next generation of socially engaged artists and is deeply influenced by Lacy. Through his performances, installations, exhibitions, and writings he addresses history, pedagogy, sociolinguistics, ethnography, and memory. This exhibition will juxtapose key examples of the artists’ works and incorporate installation, photography, drawing, and performance, alongside archival documentation which will serve to highlight overlapping themes in their practices including immigration, pedagogy, race, populism or social organizing, and theatricality. Following its presentation at the Art, Design, & Architecture Museum, UCSB, Suzanne Lacy & Pablo Helguera will travel to The 8th Floor, co-organizer of the exhibition, in New York.

Valeska Soares: Any Moment Now,"This major mid-career survey focuses on the artist’s more than 25-year exploration into ideas of time, narrative, memory, and the senses, demonstrated in her installations utilizing found and fabricated objects.


The Santa Barbara Museum of Art will organize a major mid-career survey of Brazilian-born, New York-based artist Valeska Soares. Trained as both an artist and architect, Soares creates unique environmental installations based on sensorial effects of reflection, light, entropy, and even scent. Valeska Soares: Any Moment Now will represent a more than 25-year span in the artist’s career, combining sculptures, photography, installations, and performances that integrate notions of time and memory, and conjure associations ranging from desire to excess. Soares’ work expands upon the languages of post-minimalist and conceptual art. Influenced early on by an older generation of Brazilian artists who turned their attention from the physical properties of an artwork to the perceptions and actions experienced by the viewer, she has continued to expand the boundaries of engagement. This mid-career survey will range from early assemblages and sculptures utilizing perfume and flowers, such as Pathologies (1994) and Fainting Couch (2002), to text-related works from her series Bindings (2008), to haunting marble sculptures from the series Et Aprés (2011), and to works not yet presented in the U.S., such as Unhinged (2016).",From Abstract to Conceptual Art,"Installation, Mixed Media",Ticketed,"September 17, 2017 - December 31, 2017",9/17/2017,12/31/2017,Santa Barbara Museum of Art,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Valeska-Soares-Santa-Barbara"">Link to PST Site</a>","1130 State Street

Archival materials documenting the Latino Museum’s exhibition history, along with featured work by three visual artists, highlight LA's Chicano and Latino art and culture.

From 1995 to 2000, the Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture presented exhibitions and programs celebrating the historical, artistic, and cultural contributions of Latinos in the United States. Located in downtown Los Angeles, home to the largest concentration of Mexicans living outside of Mexico, the Latino Museum was the first major institution in Southern California to address this subject. Materials documenting the Latino Museum’s exhibition history are now housed in Unique and Special Collections at California State University Channel Islands. The Latino Museum , on view at the Broome Library Gallery, will comprise a selection of edited video interviews, graphic materials, print materials and ephemera, educating viewers about the history of Chicano and Latino art and culture in Los Angeles and about the cultural impact of the museum itself. Concurrently, the Napa Hall Gallery will present works by three artists who figure prominently in the Latino Museum archives: Vibiana Aparicio’s mixed media compositions, Oscar Castillo’s photographs and Leo Limón’s paintings.

This exhibit tells the story of the influential 2,754-foot-long Great Wall of Los Angeles mural in the Tujunga Flood Control Channel and explores the history of Baca's innovation.

The Great Wall of Los Angeles is a 2,754 feet foot-long mural that runs along the concrete wall of the Tujunga Flood Control Channel in the heart of the San Fernando Valley.

CSUN’s University Galleries will present Experiments in Concrete and Collaboration: Judith F. Baca’s Reconfiguring of The Great Wall of Los Angeles after the Escuela Taller Siqueiros, an exhibition examining the largely unwritten history of Baca’s innovations alongside the methodologies that she developed as a result of her residency at the Escuela Taller Siqueiros, a workshop for muralism founded by the legendary Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros. The exhibition will tell the story of The Great Wall of Los Angeles using preparatory drawings, paintings, photographs, and ephemera, drawn largely from the archives of Baca and the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC), which oversees The Great Wall .

" Another Promised Land: Anita Brenner’s Mexico

","

This is a new perspective on the art and visual culture of Mexico and its relationship to the United States as seen through the life and work of the Mexican-born, American Jewish writer Anita Brenner.

Another Promised Land: Anita Brenner’s Mexico at the Skirball Cultural Center offers a new perspective on the art and visual culture of Mexico and its relationship to the United States as seen through the life and work of the Mexican-born, Jewish-American writer Anita Brenner (1905–1974). Brenner was an integral part of the circle of Mexican modernists in the 1920s and played an important role in promoting and translating Mexican art, culture, and history for audiences in the U.S. Brenner was close to the leading intellectuals and artists active in Mexico, including José Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jean Charlot, and Tina Modotti. An influential and prolific writer on Mexican culture, Brenner is best known for her book Idols Behind Altars: Modern Mexican Art and Its Cultural Roots (1929). The Skirball’s exhibition will provide an immersive experience of historic discovery and underscore Brenner’s importance as a Jewish woman in Mexico who inspired artists and was instrumental in introducing the North American public to Mexican history and culture.

Golden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient Americas ,"

This international loan exhibition showcases spectacular luxury arts from the royal courts of the Maya, Incas, and Aztecs.

This major international loan exhibition explores the idea of luxury in the pre-Columbian Americas, particularly as seen in the associations between materials and meanings, from about 1000 BC to the arrival of Europeans in the early 16th century. The exhibition will trace the development of metallurgy in the Andes and its expansion northward into Mexico. In contrast with people in other parts of the world, ancient Americans first used metals not for weaponry, tools, or coinage but for objects of ritual and ornament, resulting in works of extraordinary creativity. In addition to objects of gold and silver, the exhibition will feature works of art made from shell, jade, and textiles, materials that would have been considered even more valuable than noble metals. The exhibition will cast new light on the most precious works of art from the ancient Americas and provide new ways of thinking about materials, luxury and the visual arts in a global perspective. The exhibition is co-organized by the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Research Institute, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the exhibition will be on display following the Getty’s presentation.

The Metropolis in Latin America, 1830–1930 examines how imported models were reinterpreted into diverse forms of re-appropriation of the national colonial and pre-Hispanic past, ushering these cities into a process of modernization. During a decolonization progression of longue durée, centuries–old colonial cities were transformed into monumental modern metropolises, which by the end of the 1920s provide fertile ground for the emerging of today’s Latin American megalopolis.",Pre-Hispanic to Colonial," Architecture & Design, Film & Video, Photography, Prints & Drawing ",Free,"September 16, 2017 - January 07, 2018 ",9/16/2017,1/7/2018,The Getty Center ,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/The-Metropolis-Latin-America"">Link to PST Site</a>","1200 Getty Center Drive

Making Art Concrete: Works from Argentina and Brazil in the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros,"Combining art-historical and scientific analysis, this exhibition examines the formal strategies and material choices of avant-garde painters and sculptors in Argentina and Brazil.

In the years after World War II, artists in Argentina and Brazil experimented with geometric abstraction and engaged in lively debates about the role of the art work in society. Some of these artists experimented with novel synthetic materials, creating objects that offered an alternative to established traditions in painting. They proposed these objects become part of everyday, concrete reality and explored the material and theoretical limits of that proposition. Combining art-historical and scientific analysis, experts from the Getty Conservation Institute and Getty Research Institute have collaborated with the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, a world-renowned collection of Latin American art, to research the formal strategies and material decisions of artists working in the concrete and Neo-concrete vein, resulting in the first comprehensive technical study of these works. Visitors will see a selection of works by artists including Raúl Lozza, Tomás Maldonado, Rhod Rothfuss, Willys de Castro, Lygia Clark, Hélio Oiticica, and Judith Lauand alongside information about the now-invisible processes that determine the appearance of the works: supports, hanging devices, methods of paint application, and techniques of painting straight edges.

Los Angeles was also a center of production and distribution for Spanish language films. Not only have a number of the downtown cinemas been destroyed or fallen out of use, but virtually all of the films have also fallen out of history, often unpreserved or tragically lost.

Axé Bahia: The Power of Art in an Afro-Brazilian Metropolis explores the unique cultural role of the city of Salvador, the coastal capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia and one of the oldest cities in the Americas. In the 1940s, Salvador emerged as an internationally renowned center of Afro-Brazilian culture, and it remains to this day an important hub of African-inspired artistic practices in Latin America. The Fowler will present the most comprehensive exhibition in the U.S. to date of the African-inspired arts of Bahia, featuring the work of well-known modernists such as Pierre Verger and Carybé, as well as contemporary artists such as Ayrson Heráclito and Caetano Dias. Including more than 100 works from the mid-20th century to the present, the exhibition will explore the complexities of race and cultural affiliation in Brazil and the ways in which influential artists have experienced and responded creatively to the realities of Afro-Brazilian identity in Bahia.

Lineage through Landscape: Tracing Egun in Brazil by Fran Siegel,"Fran Siegel created a vast, forty-foot-long, irregular “weaving” made of strips of sun-exposed and patterned fabric crossed by lengths of delicate drawings of sacred plants.

Lineage through Landscape: Tracing Egun in Brazil by Fran Siegel is a multifaceted drawing project developed through the Los Angeles-based artist’s research residency in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Itaparica island, a vibrant center of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé. A vast, forty-foot-long, irregular “weaving” made of strips of sun-exposed and patterned fabric crossed by lengths of delicate drawings of sacred plants on translucent drafting film and cyanotypes, the work will wrap around three walls of the Museum’s “Fowler in Focus” Gallery. Finding inspiration in the worship of ancestral spirits, or Egun, in the natural environment associated with Candomblé practices on Itaparica island and in the vexed history of colonialism and slavery in Brazil, Siegel’s project can be read as a highly charged landscape of black Brazil, built from fragments that embrace its African roots. Lineage through Landscape complements the Fowler’s Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA exhibition Axé Bahia: The Power of Art in an Afro-Brazilian Metropolis.

"Talking to Action: Art, Pedagogy, and Activism in the Americas","Presented at the Ben Maltz Gallery of Otis College of Art and Design, Talking to Action: Art, Pedagogy, and Activism in the Americas investigates contemporary community-based social art practices in Latin America and Los Angeles. The exhibition will feature a range of practices that blur the lines between object making, political and environmental activism, community organizing, and performance art, through the work of contemporary artists and collectives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and the U.S. The social practice artists included in Talking to Action address critical issues such as migration and memory, mapping, environmental problems and policies, gender rights and legislation, indigenous culture, and violence. The exhibition will feature a diverse array of projects, such as an exchange of correspondence between Buenos Aires-based artist Eduardo Molinari and Los Angeles artist Sandra de la Loza about social activism in their respective cities, and the work of the Mexican collective SEFT (Sonda de Exploración Ferroviaria Tripulada), which created a playfully futuristic vehicle to explore disused railroads.

HOPE,"

This video and conceptual art exhibition will highlight how Cuba, despite its many contradictions, became one of the most interesting places for the creation of contemporary art, and new media art in particular.

Over the last five decades, Cuban artists have used video art to explore the sociological, anthropological, political, spiritual and cultural realities of the island and its purposeful isolation. Their work has explored a country torn by forces such as love and hate, desire and neglect, isolation and receptiveness, as well as western and eastern ideologies. HOPE will highlight how a country full of contradictions became one of the most interesting places for the creation of contemporary art, and new media art in particular, as these artists distinctively melded mainstream models of video art (notably including Hollywood films) with Latin American influences. With its performative and installation-driven approaches, Cuban video art also had a huge effect on the wider field of Latin American contemporary art. HOPE will give an overview of the surprising reciprocal influences of European, U.S. and Latin American video art, from pioneering works of the 1960s and new creative processes in the 1990s until the most recent developments.

Cuba Is,"This photography exhibition reveals the complexities of contemporary Cuban life, from expressions of loss and hardship of the past to the vibrancy and optimism that defines Cubans today.

Revealing complexities on--and off--the island, Cuba Is explores aspects of Cuba not easily accessed by foreigners--and sometimes not even by Cubans themselves. Born from indigenous, African and European roots, divergent politics and limitations in communication and commerce, the Cuba seen in this exhibition goes beyond the folklore and offers new insight into its current reality. Over 120 photos feature subjects ranging from defiant youth known as “Frikis” to the hard-partying children of the 1%, the underground system of sharing digital content - “El paquete” – to Miami’s Chonga girls.

Cuba Is also includes archival images and work done on assignment by five photographers: Elliot Erwitt, Leysis Quesada, Raúl Cañibano, Tria Giovan and Michael Dweck along with an original documentary, produced by the Annenberg Foundation, highlighting these photographers at work. A virtual reality experience will bring the viewers directly into Cuba’s current and dynamic music scene.","Borders, Diaspora & Displacement"," Film & Video, Photography ",Free,"September 09, 2017 - March 04, 2018 ",9/9/2017,3/4/2018,Annenberg Space for Photography ,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Photography-of-cuba"">Link to PST Site</a>","2000 Avenue of the Stars

This exploration of cross-border influences between Latino and Latin American film cultures of the last 50 years features film screenings, conversations with filmmakers, a publication, and online content.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will present a series of film screenings, conversations with filmmakers, and online content exploring the shared influences of Latino and Latin American filmmakers and the work they created or presented in Los Angeles during the past half-century. From Latin America to Hollywood: Latino Film Culture in Los Angeles is centered on a period that began with the social, cultural, and political environment of the 1960s that sparked the Chicano and New Latin American cinema movements and extends to the present day. The Academy’s programming is grounded in its extensive series of oral histories with notable Latino and Latin American filmmakers. Their films will be presented together with public conversations about filmmaking and, in some cases, will premiere new Academy Film Archive restorations.

This exhibit features a three-part series of artists who use craft to address Latino identity and the ever-mutating sociopolitical tensions in Los Angeles and California.

This exhibit features a three-part series of artists who use craft to address Latino identity and the ever-mutating sociopolitical tensions in Los Angeles and California. The first exhibition of the series will feature Los Angeles native Jaime Guerrero, one of the first artists in the world to produce life-size figures in glass. Guerrero will create a group of blown-glass, life-size sculptures representing the children who are detained at the border each day. The second exhibition will feature ceramic sculptural works by Oaxaca-born, Los Angeles-based artist Gerardo Monterrubio, who breathes new life into the ceramic vessel with his graphic, polychromatic surface imagery. The final exhibition will be a collaboration between acclaimed fiber artist Consuelo Jimenez Underwood and select students from Craft in America’s educational outreach program at Los Angeles public high schools, where the artist will work with students to create a special installation.

A Universal History of Infamy ,"

This exhibit features new works from boundary-defying artists who adopt methods from anthropology, theater, and linguisitcs at three venues from West LA to Midcity.

Referencing the title of a genre-bending collection of stories by Jorge Luis Borges, A Universal History of Infamy uses multiple venues across Los Angeles, including the LACMA campus, to present new works by more than 15 boundary-defying artists and collectives. Developed for the most part through residencies, the works represent artists who live and practice in several countries; adopt methods from disciplines such as anthropology, theater, and linguistics; mingle research with visual art; and work across a range of media, from installation and sculpture to performance and video. A Universal History of Infamy embraces the collaborative spirit of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, bringing together one of the largest partners, LACMA, with one of the smallest, the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, which organized the residencies.

Playing with Fire: Paintings by Carlos Almaraz ,"

One of the most influential artists whose artistic, cultural, and political motivations catalyzed the Chicano Art movement in the 1970s, Almaraz straddled multiple—and often contradictory— identities.

Playing with Fire: Paintings by Carlos Almaraz is the first major retrospective of one of the most influential Los Angeles artists of the 1970s and 1980s. Arguably the first of the many Chicano artists whose artistic, cultural, and political motivations catalyzed the Chicano Art movement in the 1970s, Almaraz began his career with political works for the farm workers’ Causa and co-founded the important artist collective Los Four. Although he saw himself as a cultural activist, Almaraz straddled multiple—and often contradictory—identities that drew from divergent cultures and mores, and his art became less political in focus and more personal, psychological, dreamlike, even mythic and mystical as he evolved artistically. The first to focus predominantly on Almaraz’s large-scale paintings, the exhibition features more than 60 works and includes pastels, ephemera, and notebooks, mostly from 1967 through 1989, the year of the artist’s untimely death at age 48.

This exhibition represents the first serious effort to reposition the history of Mexican painting during the 18th century, a vibrant period marked by major stylistic changes and the invention of new iconographies.

Painted in Mexico, 1700-1790: Pinxit Mexici is a groundbreaking exhibition devoted to a particularly rich period in the history of Mexican painting, marked by major stylistic developments and the invention of fascinating new iconographies. The exhibition presents more than 120 works, many of which have never been shown publicly and were especially restored for this exhibition, contributing to a lasting understanding of Mexican painting and trans-Atlantic artistic connections in the 18th century. The seven themes—Great Masters, Master Story Tellers, Paintings of the Land, The Power of Portraiture, The Allegorical World, and Imagining the Sacred—explore the painters’ great inventiveness and the varying contexts in which they created their works. The exhibition represents the first and most serious effort to date to reposition the history of 18th-century painting in Mexico and will be accompanied by a fully illustrated publication, with scholarly essays written by the leading experts in the field. Co-organized with Fomento Cultural Banamex, Mexico City, the exhibition will subsequently travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The Cuban Matrix ,"

This in-depth look at contemporary Cuban artwork focuses on the digital media exchange culture of “El Paquete Seminal”: a mirror and method to scrutinize the relationship of Cuban artists to contemporary art and culture within Cuba and internationally.

The Cuban Matrix is an ambitious project featuring an in-depth look at contemporary Cuban artwork, with emphasis on digital media exchange culture. Cuba is navigating two distinct temporal realities: the reality of economic isolation (the blockade) and that of instant communication made possible by increasing access to technology. The focus of The Cuban Matrix is the offline digital “mercado” (marketplace) sharing culture that has arisen around the phenomenon of “El Paquete Semanal”: a weekly terabyte packet comprised of downloaded webpages,information, and entertainment that is shared and consumed throughout Cuban society—a solution to the country’s limited access to virtual information systems. The works comprising The Cuban Matrix explore aspects of the digital mediation between Cuba and the rest of the world, delving into the intersection between the country’s isolation and its increasing interaction with modern technology.

This exhibition is a three-channel video installation that explores the social and political contradictions of the ongoing Central American children refugee crisis, immigration and the inadequacies of borders and nationalism.

The Torrance Art Museum will present the 2015 project Yoshua Okón: Oracle , a multi-channel video installation exploring immigration, borders and nationalism. In 2014, Oracle, Arizona was the site of a large-scale protest against the entrance of unaccompanied children from Central America into the United States. Exploring both sides of the conflict, Okón spoke with children as well as members of AZ Border Defenders, the group that orchestrated the protest. The protestors are filmed in stark contrast to the children, who sing about the 1954 US invasion of Guatemala and the involvement of the government with transnational corporations. The title also refers to Oracle Corporation, a company whose first customer was the CIA. The installation questions the adequacy and the relevance of nationalism in this transnational age.

Video Art in Latin America is the first major U.S. survey of the subject from the late 1960s until today, featuring works rarely if ever seen in the U.S. and introducing audiences to groundbreaking achievements throughout Latin America. The exhibition begins with the earliest experiments in South America, where video became an important medium for expressing dissent during an era dominated by repressive military regimes, and follows themes that emerged in multiple artistic centers throughout Latin America, from labor, ecology, and migration to borders, memory, and consumption. The exhibition also highlights the ways in which contemporary video artists in Latin America continue to pursue the sociopolitical commitment of earlier work, exploring themes related to identity and the consequences of social inequality, without shying away from humor and irony. The single-channel video programs will be complemented by a selection of environmental video installations.

LACE and Pitzer College Art Galleries will mount a two-part exhibition on the early performance-based works of Juan Downey (1940-1993). Born in Chile, Downey moved to Paris in the 1960s and later settled in Washington, D.C., and then New York, where he developed a practice that included sculpture, performance, installation, and video. Although Downey has become known for his multi-channel video works such as Video Trans Americas (1973–1976) and The Thinking Eye (1976–1977), which critique Eurocentric perspectives regarding Latin American identity, Juan Downey: Radiant Nature will consider his earlier artistic practice. Comprising interactive electronic sculptures, happenings and performances, as well as installation, these earlier bodies of work will be explored for their progressive trans-disciplinary investigation of technology, energy, the environment, and politics.

Six Southern California–based artists lead multimedia projects mapping the geopolitical implications of the largest West Coast ports situated in San Pedro as part of a larger conversation about the United States border.

Part of a year-long series of artist-led programs, Coastal/Border will examine the function of the San Pedro coast as a national border and its impact on the Latino/Latina communities of the Los Angeles Harbor Region as part of a larger conversation about the United States border. The exhibition will emerge from a site-specific performance series and closely related social practice workshops. Six artists will be invited to create research-driven performances centered on specific sites in the Los Angeles Harbor Region, such as the Port of America, Terminal Island, and Fort MacArthur. As part of their extended research process, the artists will also lead educational workshops to allow for meaningful community involvement in the resulting exhibition and performances.

James hd Brown: Life and Work in Mexico ,"

This exhibition will feature Brown’s creation of limited-edition artists' books in collaboration with influential artists from the US and Mexico. Also featured are Brown's own large-scale paintings in a seminal series called “My Other House.""

Born in 1951 in Glendale, CA, James hd Brown relocated with his family to Oaxaca, Mexico in 1995 where he founded Carpe Diem Press. Collaborating with Linotípográfica Quintas, Brown creates limited edition art books featuring the work of influential artists from the US and Mexico. Brown often includes original prints made by the artists to be inserted in the books themselves. USC Fisher Museum of Art will highlight Brown’s unique artist press, featuring approximately twenty books and related ephemera. Some of the artists in the Carpe Diem series include Joan Jonas, Graciela Iturbide, Kiki Smith, and Francisco Toledo. Brown will be producing a new artist book especially for PST: LA/LA. The exhibition will also feature Brown’s ""My Other House,” begun in 2009 and worked on continuously since then. The idea for this project came to Brown after his two sons discovered a staircase in their home, leading to an “almost secret” mezzanine. Nobody else was allowed in this place, a sanctuary that the boys called “my other house”. Brown began investigating the idea of having another physical or imaginary place that is fundamental to one's creative and imaginative life. “My Other House"" will be installed in the four main galleries at the USC Fisher Museum of Art.

Circles and Circuits I: History and Art of the Chinese Caribbean Diaspora ,"

The first of a two part exhibition, this collection features art of the Chinese Caribbean diaspora from the 1930s to present day and reveals the hidden complexities of the transcultural nature of the Caribbean.

Circles and Circuits explores the art of the Chinese Caribbean diaspora from the early 20th century to the present day. By examining the contributions of artists of Chinese descent in Cuba, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and beyond, the exhibition will reveal the hidden complexities of the transcultural art of the Caribbean. The exhibition will be presented at two venues, the Chinese American Museum (CAM) and the California African American Museum (CAAM). The presentation at CAAM will trace the history of Chinese Caribbean art from the 1930s through the period of the region’s independence movements, showcasing the contributions of artists little known outside their own countries, such as Sybil Atteck (Trinidad and Tobago) and Manuel Chong-Neto (Panama), and providing a new context for understanding the better-known work of Wifredo Lam (Cuba). At CAM, the exhibition will focus on the work of contemporary artists such as Albert Chong and María Magdalena Campos-Pons, as well as artists of the ongoing Chinese Caribbean diaspora. The contemporary works featured explore issues of post-colonial history, popular culture, personal history, and the body.

This exhibit explores how bilingual newspaper La Raza provided a voice to the Chicano Rights Movement, positioning photography not only as an artistic medium but also as a powerful tool of social activism.

Published in Los Angeles from 1967-1977, the influential bilingual newspaper La Raza provided a voice to the Chicano Rights Movement. La Raza engaged photographers not only as journalists but also as artists and activists to capture the definitive moments, key players, and signs and symbols of Chicano activism. The archive of nearly 25,000 images created by these photographers, now housed at the Chicano Studies Research Center at UCLA, provides the foundation for an exhibition exploring photography’s role in articulating the social and political concerns of the Chicano Movement during a pivotal time in the art and history of the United States. LA RAZA will be the most sustained examination to date of both the photography and the alternative press of the Chicano Movement, positioning photography not only as an artistic medium but also as a powerful tool of social activism.

Anna Maria Maiolino ,"

This first US retrospective of the work of Brazilian artist Anna Maria Maiolino brings together over five decades of paintings, drawings, videos, performances, sculptures, and large-scale installations to chart the path of an extraordinary artist.

The Museum of Contemporary Art will present the first major survey exhibition in the U.S. of Anna Maria Maiolino, one of the most influential Brazilian artists of her generation. Maiolino was born in Italy in 1942 and emigrated with her family to Venezuela as a teenager. In 1960 she moved to Brazil to attend the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, where she began to develop a body of work in dialogue with abstraction, minimalism, and conceptualism. Her work was profoundly influenced by the aftermath of the Second World War, the military dictatorship in Brazil, and her experience as an artist during the period when what could be called art changed dramatically. The exhibition will cover Maiolino’s entire career, from the 1960s until the present, bringing together early experimental prints, drawings, films, performances, and installations, including her recent large-scale ephemeral installations made with unfired, hand-rolled clay. Maiolino’s work is uniquely capable of tracing the course of the movements that define Brazilian art history, channeled via a personal, psychologically charged practice that charts her own introspective path as much as it opens on to large philosophical questions of repetition and difference, the transient and the permanent, and aesthetic problems such as solid and void and the intimate relationship between drawing and sculpture.

Los Angeles was also a center of production and distribution for Spanish language films. Not only have a number of the downtown cinemas been destroyed or fallen out of use, but virtually all of the films have also fallen out of history, often unpreserved or tragically lost.

"¡Murales Rebeldes! L.A. Chicana/o Murals under Siege


","Chicana/o murals in LA express identity, empower communities, and challenge dominant cultural norms, making them targets of censorship and destruction. Through stories of eight murals, this exhibition documents controversy and loss while celebrating artistic and historical contributions.

¡Murales Rebeldes! L.A. Chicana/o Murals under Siege looks at how Chicana/o murals in the greater Los Angeles area have been contested, challenged, censored, and even destroyed. During the late 1960s and 1970s, murals became an essential form of artistic response and public voice for the Chicano Movement, at a time when other channels of communication were limited for the Mexican-American community. The alternative vision of community empowerment these works presented could be transformative for some and deeply unsettling for others. The exhibition will examine a group of murals produced in the greater Los Angeles area in the 1970s to the 1990s that were subsequently threatened or destroyed, including murals by Barbara Carrasco, Roberto Chavez, Willie Herrón, and Sergio O’Cadiz, among others. By presenting this series of case studies, or “mural stories,” LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, in collaboration with the California Historical Society, will examine how the iconography, content, and artistic strategies of the muralists challenged dominant cultural norms and historical narratives.",Definitions of Identity," Film & Video, Murals, Painting, Photography, Prints & Drawing ",Free,"September 23, 2017 - February 27, 2018 ",9/23/2017,2/27/2018,LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Murales-Rebeldes"">Link to PST Site</a>","501 North Main Street

Circles and Circuits II: Contemporary Chinese Caribbean Art ,"The second of a two part exhibition, this collection includes contemporary art of the Chinese Caribbean diaspora that reveals the hidden complexities of the transcultural nature of the Caribbean.

Circles and Circuits explores the art of the Chinese Caribbean diaspora from the early 20th century to the present day. By examining the contributions of artists of Chinese descent in Cuba, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and beyond, the exhibition will reveal the hidden complexities of the transcultural art of the Caribbean. The exhibition will be presented at two venues, the Chinese American Museum (CAM) and the California African American Museum (CAAM). The presentation at CAAM will trace the history of Chinese Caribbean art from the 1930s through the period of the region’s independence movements, showcasing the contributions of artists little known outside their own countries, such as Sybil Atteck (Trinidad and Tobago) and Manuel Chong-Neto (Panama), and providing a new context for understanding the better-known work of Wifredo Lam (Cuba). At CAM, the exhibition will focus on the work of contemporary artists such as Albert Chong and María Magdalena Campos-Pons, as well as artists of the ongoing Chinese Caribbean diaspora. The contemporary works featured explore issues of post-colonial history, popular culture, personal history, and the body.","Borders, Diaspora & Displacement"," Film & Video, Installation, Mixed Media, Murals, Painting, Photography, Prints & Drawing, Sculpture ",Donations,"September 15, 2017 - March 11, 2018 ",9/15/2017,3/11/2018,Chinese American Museum ,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Circles-and-Circuits-II-Contemporary"">Link to PST Site</a>","425 North Los Angeles Street

"Transpacific Borderlands: The Art of Japanese Diaspora in Lima, Los Angeles, Mexico City, and São Paulo","

Through themes such as homeland, identity, and hybridity, Transpacific Borderlands examines the experiences of selected artists of Japanese ancestry living in Latin America and predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Southern California.

Transpacific Borderlands will expand our understanding of what constitutes Latin American art by highlighting the work of 17 contemporary artists of Japanese ancestry from Lima, Los Angeles, Mexico City, and São Paulo. The exhibition explores the differing historical events and generations of diaspora that have shaped the work of these artists and the fundamental questions their work poses about migration, the fluidity of culture, and what it means to be Nikkei, Latin American, or Latino. In the 20th century, Japanese migrants arrived in large numbers in North and South America. Their experiences differed by country, ranging from strong assimilation in Mexico to cultural hybridity in Brazil to the trauma of wartime incarceration in the United States. Transpacific Borderlands presents artists whose works can be read with and against these histories, including Eduardo Tokeshi (Peru), Madalena Hashimoto Cordaro (Brazil), and Shizu Saldamando (U.S.). Ultimately, Transpacific Borderlands will contribute to a broader reconsideration of identity in a world where the meanings of race and ethnicity are constantly evolving, and where artists often inhabit dynamic transnational spaces.

"Día de los Muertos: A Cultural Legacy, Past, Present, and Future ","

This exhibit follows the evolution of Self Help Graphics' celebration of Día de los Muertos through historical prints, photographs, and ephemera, tracing the evolution from an indigenous tradition to a remixed fusion of cultures.

Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is an integral part of the cultural and artistic landscape of Los Angeles. Today’s interpretation of the sacred indigenous tradition has been remixed and recycled into a commercial holiday blending Mexican, Latino, and American pop culture iconography with the spiritual aesthetics of the event’s indigenous and Catholic influences. Self Help Graphics (SHG) will trace the evolution of Día de los Muertos in Los Angeles and beyond through an exhibition and publication documenting its four-decade history of art, ritual, and celebration. Since 1972, when SHG organized its first public ritual for Día de los Muertos, its annual commemoration has developed into a complex and unique public observance. Día de los Muertos: A Cultural Legacy, Past, Present, and Future will include historical prints, photographs, and ephemera representing each decade of SHG’s commemorations, as well as three newly commissioned altars from artists Ofelia Esparza (Los Angeles), Gerardo “Acamonchi” Yépiz (Tijuana), and Marcus Kuiland-Nazario (Los Angeles).

Relational Undercurrents: Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago ,"

This exhibition defines the Caribbean as an archipelago of islands to emphasize thematic continuities of art and diasporas, challenging conventional geographic and conceptual boundaries of Latin America.

Relational Undercurrents: Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago will call attention to a region of the Americas that is difficult to categorize and often overlooked: the island nations of the Caribbean. The exhibition proposes an “archipelagic model”—defining the Caribbean from the perspective of its archipelago of islands, as distinct from the continental experience—to study issues around race, history, the legacy of colonialism, and the environment. The exhibition features artists from the Hispanophone, Anglophone, Francophone, and Dutch Caribbean. Relational Undercurrents will emphasize the thematic continuities of art made throughout the archipelago and its diasporas, challenging conventional geographic and conceptual boundaries of Latin America. This approach draws particular attention to issues arising from the colonial legacy that are relevant to Latin America as a whole, but which emerge as central to the work of 21st-century Caribbean artists, including Janine Antoni (Bahamas), Humberto Diáz (Cuba), Jorge Pineda (Dominican Republic), and Allora & Calzadilla (Puerto Rico).

Winds from Fusang: Mexico and China in the Twentieth Century ,"

This exhibition explores the unexamined influence of Mexican art and artists on the development of art in China, offering a greater understanding of ties between trans-Pacific creative communities.

Winds from Fusang: Cultural Dialogues between Mexican and Chinese Artists will be the first major exhibition to explore the influence of 20th-century Latin American art and artists on contemporary Chinese art. While it is generally believed that only after the “opening” of China in the 1980s did the West begin to play a significant role in shaping contemporary Chinese art, there were, in fact, other Western influences prior to the Cultural Revolution, especially at mid- century, when China was supposedly closed to the outside world. Using works from public and private collections in the U.S., China, and Latin America, Crossing Pacific will demonstrate how themes, techniques, and specific artists from Mexico and other Latin American countries who visited China—including José Venturelli, Miguel Covarrubias, and David Alfaro Siqueiros--had an outsized influence on the burgeoning Chinese contemporary art community.

After moving to Los Angeles in 1976, Lamelas participated in the Long Beach Museum’s influential video arts program, and his ongoing conceptual practice influenced an emerging circle of L.A. artists. Since 1988, Lamelas has divided his time among various cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Brussels, Berlin, and Paris, and the nomadic nature of his practice has been an important influence on his creative production.

"Visual Voyages: Images of Latin American Nature from Columbus to Darwin

","

This exhibit seeks new understandings of Latin American nature through connections between art, science, and the environment from the voyages of Columbus to the publications of Charles Darwin.

Visual Voyages: Images of Latin American Nature from Columbus to Darwin surveys the connections among art, science, and the environment in Latin America, from the voyages of Columbus to the publications of Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century. The exhibition will introduce audiences to new understandings of Latin American nature from a range of cultural perspectives: as a wondrous earthly paradise; as a new source of profitable commodities such as chocolate, tobacco, and cochineal; as a landscape of good and evil, as viewed through the filter of religion; as the site for an Enlightenment project of collecting and classifying; and, in the 19th century, as the reflection of a national spirit. Visual Voyages features approximately 100 objects that are drawn from the Huntington’s library, art, and botanical holdings, as well as from dozens of international collections, in a range of media including paintings, rare books, illustrated manuscripts, prints, and drawings. Importantly, the exhibition and its catalogue will bring together indigenous and European depictions of Latin American nature and offer a strongly documented case for Latin America’s own active participation in the production of excellent and influential scientific and artistic works during the early modern period.

My Barrio: Emigdio Vasquez and Chicana/o Identity in Orange County ,"

An exhibition and app investigate Emigdio Vasquez’s prolific mural career and its contemporary context, celebrating the Chicano cultural movement through depictions of local communities alongside imagery from Mexican and American history.

In 2014, Chapman University partnered with the Orange Barrio Historical Society and local artist Higgy Vasquez to restore a 34-year-old mural, El Proletariado de Aztlán , on the exterior of a former apartment complex adjacent to the university. The mural was originally painted in 1979 by Higgy’s father, Emigdio Vasquez, a prolific artist who painted 22 public murals in Orange County between 1976 and 2006. Vasquez’ murals celebrated the Chicano cultural movement, depicting local people and places alongside imagery from Mexican and Mexican-American history. For Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, Chapman’s curatorial team will launch the first comprehensive investigation of these local murals and the communities they identify. Satellite exhibitions on campus at the Guggenheim Gallery and the University Student Union will highlight the work of contemporary Chicana/o muralists and display historical artifacts and photos relating to Chicano murals in Orange County, and a downloadable app will enable users to view an interactive map of historic mural sites for a self-guided tour that provides information on each work, including those that have been destroyed.

In 2014, Chapman University partnered with the Orange Barrio Historical Society and local artist Higgy Vasquez to restore a 34-year-old mural, El Proletariado de Aztlán , on the exterior of a former apartment complex adjacent to the university. The mural was originally painted in 1979 by Higgy’s father, Emigdio Vasquez, a prolific artist who painted 22 public murals in Orange County between 1976 and 2006. Vasquez’ murals celebrated the Chicano cultural movement, depicting local people and places alongside imagery from Mexican and Mexican-American history. For Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, Chapman’s curatorial team will launch the first comprehensive investigation of these local murals and the communities they identify. Satellite exhibitions on campus at the Guggenheim Gallery and the University Student Union will highlight the work of contemporary Chicana/o muralists and display historical artifacts and photos relating to Chicano murals in Orange County, and a downloadable app will enable users to view an interactive map of historic mural sites for a self-guided tour that provides information on each work, including those that have been destroyed.

" Aztlán to Magulandia: The Journey of Chicano Artist Gilbert ""Magu"" Luján

","Luján is known for his colorful and visually complex explorations of Chicano culture and community, often resulting in pyramid-mounted low riders driven by anthropomorphic dogs through a mythologized LA

University Art Galleries, UC Irvine (UAG) will present the first survey of one of the most iconic figures of the Chicano Art Movement, Gilbert ""Magu"" Luján (1940–2011) and an accompanying publication. One of the founding members of the Chicano artists collective Los Four, Luján is known for his colorful and visually complex explorations of Chicano culture and community that drew upon and brought to life various historic and contemporary visual sources with startling results: Pyramid-mounted low riders driven by anthropomorphic dogs traversing a newly defined and mythologized L.A. He was part of a small group of dedicated artists and intellectuals who set about defining a Chicano identity and culture as part of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. The UAG’s retrospective will focus on creativity and invention in Luján's work in a myriad of sketches and drawings, paintings, and sculptures. Luján combined two world-making concepts, Aztlán, the mythic northern ancestral home of the indigenous Mexican Aztecs that became a charged symbol of Chicano activism; and Magulandia, the term Luján coined for the space in which he lived and produced his work, and for his work as a whole. Together, Aztlán and Magulandia represented both physical spaces and the complex cultural, geographic, and conceptual relationships that exist between Los Angeles and Mexico and served as dual landscapes for Luján’s artistic philosophy and cultural creativity.",Definitions of Identity," Mixed Media, Prints & Drawing, Sculpture ",Free,"October 07, 2017 - December 16, 2017 ",10/7/2017,12/16/2017,"University Art Galleries, UC Irvine","<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/The-Journey-of-Chicano-Artist-Gilbert"">Link to PST Site</a>","University of California, Irvine, 712 Arts Plaza

"California Mexicana: Missions to Murals, 1820–1930 ","

This exhibit explores how Mexico became California and the role of visual arts in this transformation, creating distinct pictorial motifs and symbols that helped define the new California.

California Mexicana: Missions to Murals, 1820–1930 , explores how Mexico became California. Following the U.S.-Mexican War (1846–1848), lands that had belonged for centuries to New Spain, and later Mexico, were transformed into the 31st state of the U.S. The visual arts played a strong role in this transformation, creating distinct pictorial motifs and symbols that helped define the new California while establishing dialogues and intersections with the land’s previous identity as Mexico. Juxtaposing paintings with popular posters, prints, and some of the earliest movies made in Los Angeles, the exhibition reveals how this image of California spread worldwide. Objects range from picturesque landscapes of Alta California and still life paintings featuring fruits, flowers, and other plants that celebrated the state's agricultural growth, to works by early modernists such as the Mexican painters Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. California Mexicana: Missions to Murals, 1820–1930 , demonstrates how a unique amalgam of Mexican and Anglo visual traditions created a profile for California distinct from any other U.S. state.

Within a culture, a socio-political movement and a profession dominated by men, artists Judithe Hernández and Patssi Valdez have each created bodies of works that profoundly influenced the aesthetic voices of Latinas in the latter half of the 20th century. The two artists took seemingly parallel paths from their childhoods in East L.A. to their coming-of-age during the Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the 1970s.

Aztlán: A Sense of Place


","

This exhibit explores the roots of the Chicano/a art movement and the vast influences that Chicano/a culture has had on the southwestern United States and beyond.

For the past thirteen years, the dA Center for the Arts has presented Aztlán , an exploration of the roots of the Chicano/a art movement and the vast influences that Chicano/a culture has had on the southwestern United States and beyond. This annual exhibition began in 2003, curated by Frank Garcia in tandem with artist and activist Gilbert “Magu” Lujan, a member of Los Four, an East L.A. artist group that was one of the vanguards of the Chicano/a art movement. An unfolding observation of the transformation of real cultures in a mythological land, Aztlán has evolved from a focus on original Mesoamerican first nations to include people and cultures from around the world. Aztlán: A Sense of Place will connect imagination, tradition and technology through works by artists including Jimmy Centeno, Margaret Garcia, Frank Romero, Nancy Romero, David Botello and Wayne Healy, among others, to provoke an engaging dialogue between individuals, communities, and institutions.

"Kukuli Velarde: Plunder Me, Baby


","

These personal and sometimes confrontational ceramic sculptures are based on traditional forms and surface decorations of Pre-Columbian ceramics but include the artist’s own image and reference her indigenous ancestry.

The American Museum of Ceramic Art (AMOCA) will present Kukuli Velarde: Plunder Me, Baby, the first West Coast exhibition by the U.S.-based Peruvian artist Kukuli Velarde, who was born in Cusco in 1962 and moved to the U.S. in 1988. The 15 ceramic sculptures in the exhibition evoke a childhood memory that has haunted Velarde, of hearing her 16-year-old nanny declare ""I don't speak Quechua"" (the language of the Inca) in an attempt to hide her indigenous roots. To challenge this racism, Velarde creates personal and sometimes confrontational ceramic sculptures which are based on the traditional forms and surface decorations of Pre-Columbian ceramics but include the artist’s own image and reference her indigenous ancestry. Kukuli Velarde: Plunder Me, Baby was previously presented at the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City in 2013. This presentation at AMOCA reunites all of the ceramic sculptures from that exhibition and augments them with a selection of Pre-Columbian ceramic objects to illustrate Velarde’s source material.

Prometheus 2017: Four Artists from Mexico Revisit Orozco ,"Reexamining José Clemente Orozco's mural Prometheus, four contemporary artists from Mexico share Orozco's interest in the relationships between history, storytelling, and power, as they navigate their own 21st-century approach to political causes and personal mythologies.

In 1930, José Clemente Orozco completed his Prometheus fresco at Pomona College, the first mural painted in the United States by one of Los Tres Grandes of Mexican muralism. Drawing on the Greek myth of the Titan Prometheus bringing fire to humanity, Orozco's mural goes beyond the story's traditional symbolism to present a complex political work that questions the very idea of enlightenment in a modern world steeped in conflict. The exhibition Prometheus 2017: Four Artists from Mexico Revisit Orozco will reexamine Orozco's mural through the lens of four contemporary women artists from Mexico—Isa Carrillo, Adela Goldbard, Rita Ponce de León, and Naomi Rincón-Gallardo—who are producing a variety of socially-engaged artworks. These four contemporary Mexican artists share Orozco’s interest in the relationships among history, storytelling, and power, but navigate their own 21st-century approach to political causes and personal mythologies.

"Revolution and Ritual: The Photographs of Sara Castrejón, Graciela Iturbide, and Tatiana Parcero ","

These works from representative figures of three generations of Mexican photographers invite visitors to consider how photography has been transformed over the past one hundred years in Mexico.

Revolution and Ritual: The Photographs of Sara Castrejón, Graciela Iturbide, and Tatiana Parcero brings together works by representative figures of three generations of photographers in Mexico, their careers spanning 100 years. Castrejón, the least known of the three, was one of the few female photographers who documented the Mexican Revolution. Iturbide is known best for her photographs of the daily lives of Mexico's indigenous cultures, while Parcero, a contemporary photographer, splices images of her own body with cosmological maps and pre-Columbian Aztec codices. By bringing their work into conversation, Revolution and Ritual will invite visitors to consider how photography has been transformed over the past century in Mexico and how it continues to respond to artists’ interest in representing present and past, self and other. The exhibition draws on Scripps College’s academic strength in feminist and gender studies and the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery’s expanding photography collection, with its special emphasis on women who have shaped the photographic field.

LACE and Pitzer College Art Galleries will mount a two-part exhibition on the early performance-based works of Juan Downey (1940-1993). Born in Chile, Downey moved to Paris in the 1960s and later settled in Washington, D.C., and then New York, where he developed a practice that included sculpture, performance, installation, and video. Although Downey has become known for his multi-channel video works such as Video Trans Americas (1973–1976) and The Thinking Eye (1976–1977), which critique Eurocentric perspectives regarding Latin American identity, Juan Downey: Radiant Nature will consider his earlier artistic practice. Comprising interactive electronic sculptures, happenings and performances, as well as installation, these earlier bodies of work will be explored for their progressive trans-disciplinary investigation of technology, energy, the environment, and politics.

UnDocumenta ,"

Artists from San Diego and Tijuana use technology, performance, and interactivity to address biculturalism, migration, labor issues, and human rights.

Subverting the title of one of the premier European art events, the Oceanside Museum of Art will present unDocumenta , an exhibition referencing the plight of undocumented people and highlighting the artistic production at the convergence of Latin America and Southern California. The San Diego/Tijuana region serves as a birthplace and rich experimental ground for individual artists and collectives such as the Border Arts Workshop and Las Comadres that have been concerned with topics related to biculturalism, migration, labor issues, and human rights. Grounded within that framework, unDocumenta will incorporate artworks by Mexican and Latino artists from both cities with a focus on the use of recent technology, performance, and interactivity. One such example is a work by Omar Pimienta, Free Citizenship , in which the artist sets up a Mobile Consulate at the museum, offering “citizenship” and a free passport to members of the audience in exchange for an old passport, allowing the viewer to think of the tenuous state of those who cross borders into the unknown. Other participating artists include Claudia Cano, Ana Teresa Fernandez, Dominic Paul Miller and Marcos Ramirez ERRE.

"Myth & Mirage: Inland Southern California, Birthplace of the Spanish Colonial Revival ","This exhibition provides a fresh view of Inland Southern California as the epicenter of Spanish Colonial Revival innovation and includes a critical examination of cultural whitewashing in the tourism industry.

The Spanish Colonial Revival has been part of the aesthetic fabric of Southern California for 100 years. While claiming ties to Colonial Spain and Mexico via their cultural and design traditions, the style was based largely on myth and invention. Influenced by such diverse sources as the 1915 Panama-California Exposition and the popular Ramona novel and pageants, Californian architects and designers adapted Spanish Colonial, Mission, ecclesiastical, and native elements to create romanticized perceptions of California for a burgeoning tourism industry. The Riverside Art Museum will present the first survey of the Spanish Colonial Revival style in the architecture and the decorative arts of the Inland Empire, where this style flourished. Landmarks such as Myron Hunt's First Congregational Church of Riverside (1912–1914) and the historic Mission Inn Hotel are spectacular amalgamations of the historic and the imagined.

Xerografia: Copyart in Brazil, 1970-1990 will reveal the innovative uses of ordinary commercial copying practices by artists working in Brazil across two politically fraught decades. The exhibition will introduce Southern California audiences to this unfamiliar and often overlooked work, including not only the innumerable images made on standard copy paper but also works machine-printed on unconventional materials such as metal, wood, and glass. The low cost of production and unique formal qualities of photocopies, including imperfections that the machine introduced, initially attracted artists like Paulo Bruscky to the medium. Later on, artists including Hudinilson Jr. and Mário Ramiro performed actions in front of the photocopier, using it as a sort of camera. Eventually, this experimentation led to work in fax, videotext, and other forms of early new media. In essence, photocopy became a new artistic medium, offering exciting possibilities for performance, documentation, publishing, and even international exchange through mail art strategies.",From Abstract to Conceptual Art,"Film & Video, Mixed Media, Prints & Drawing",Free,"September 15, 2017 - December 16, 2017",9/15/2017,12/16/2017,"University Galleries, University of San Diego ","<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Copyart-in-Brazil-1970-to-1990s"">Link to PST Site</a>","5998 Alcala Park

Memories of Underdevelopment ,"

This exhibition examines the ways in which Latin American artists from the 1960s to the 1980s responded to the unraveling of the utopian promise of modernization after World War II.

In collaboration with Museo Jumex in Mexico City and the Museo de Arte de Lima, MCASD will present an exhibition examining the ways in which Latin American artists from the 1960s to the 1980s responded to the unraveling of the utopian promise of modernization after World War II, most notably in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. In the immediate postwar period, artists had eagerly embraced the “transition to modernity,” creating a new abstract geometric language meant to capture its idealistic possibilities. As modernization failed, and political oppression and brutal military dictatorships followed, avant-garde artists increasingly abandoned abstraction and sought new ways to connect with the public, engaging directly with communities and often incorporating popular strategies from film, theater, and architecture into their work. Memories of Underdevelopment will be the first significant survey exhibition of these crucial decades and will highlight the work not only of well-known artists such as Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Pape but also lesser-known artists from Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay.

The Museum of Photographic Arts (MOPA) will present Point/Counterpoint: Contemporary Mexican Photography , featuring work by nineteen contemporary Mexican photographers, who explore recent, and often difficult, political, economic, and social realities of contemporary Mexico. Featuring more than one hundred works created between 2000 and 2015, including individual photographs, groupings of works, installation pieces, and videos, the exhibition will be organized by themes, including abstraction, irony, otherness, and pain, and will challenge audiences to reconsider expectations of photography in Mexico during this period.

"Kinesthesia: Latin American Kinetic Art, 1954–1969","This exhibition examines the role played by South American artists in the international Kinetic Art movement, which focused on sculpture that used movement for its effects and installations that produced optical sensations.

Kinesthesia: Latin American Kinetic Art , 1954–1969 will examine the influential and visually stunning work of South American kinetic artists. While Southern California was becoming the North American epicenter for Light and Space art in the 1960s, separate yet closely related technical experiments had been unfolding in a handful of major cities of South America, as well as in Paris, the European center for kinetic art. Kinesthesia will highlight the broad differences that emerged among the two principal South American centers of activity: Argentina, where kinetic art grew out of local debates about painting; and Venezuela, where pioneering notions of modern architecture stimulated a synthesis of art and design. Kinesthesia will tell this story through 50 works—primarily kinetic sculptures and sculptural installations—by Jesús Rafael Soto, Julio Le Parc, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Martha Boto, and others.",From Abstract to Conceptual Art,"Architecture & Design, Film & Video, Installation, Mixed Media, Painting, Photography, Prints & Drawing, Sculpture",Ticketed,"August 26, 2017 - January 15, 2018",8/26/2017,1/15/2018,Palm Springs Art Museum ,"<a href=""http://www.pacificstandardtime.org/en/exhibitions/exhibit/view/Kinesthesia-Latin-America-Kinetic-Art"">Link to PST Site</a>","300 S Palm Canyon Drive
